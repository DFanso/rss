After getting our children to their school/daycare for the day I went to our local coffee shop to pick us up each a cup, I figured it can either be seen as a show of care or a peace offering. Once I got home he was sitting at our island doom scrolling through TikTok (I think we’ve all been there), I decided standing across from him would be a bit of a better choice so I gave us our respective cups and asked if I could get his attention for a conversation. Well what I hoped would be productive turned unproductive quickly as he sighed with an eye roll and turned off his phone, I started by asking the big question of if he wanted anymore children, I even suggested he doesn’t think about what I said on the subject and just tell me his feelings about more children; with that he answered a firm no and told me as he said before a third child is and will always be off the table. I then asked him if he had any fears or concerns about surgeries/medical procedures, he said no to this question as well. So I asked if he understood the procedure and what it entailed and he said yes he does which is why he doesn’t want me to get it done, in his words I wouldn’t be a woman if I got any part of my reproductive organs (what makes me a woman) removed and he refuses to allow me down that path. I then followed up by asking about his getting a vasectomy and he said it’s pretty much the same thing for men and he won’t let anyone take away if manhood. The final question I managed to ask was did he just expect me to be on birth control forever and this man looked me in m face and said it’s worked so well for me already why change things up, guys as I stated in my previous post I am miserable and in debilitating pain with birth control. At the end of this I just grabbed my coffee and went sit on our porch just trying to wrap my head around the conversation while he sit in the house acting like nothing is wrong and we’re just having a normal day off together…..\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- SC_ON --\u003e \u0026#32; submitted by \u0026#32; \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kimber_Rex22\"\u003e /u/Kimber_Rex22 \u003c/a\u003e \u0026#32; to \u0026#32; \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/\"\u003e r/AITAH \u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j5pxz6/update_aitah_for_sterilizing_myself_against_my/\"\u003e[link]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u0026#32; \u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j5pxz6/update_aitah_for_sterilizing_myself_against_my/\"\u003e[comments]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e",

A few days ago he had some chest pains and low blood pressure. I told him he needed to go in and 4am admitted. The Dr decided a procedure that would put him under was needed for answers. He had to leave his phone and belongings. His phone rang while he was out and I missed it, so I went to check to see who called and when trying to put in the pin got the error that pin was incorrect. I didn\u0026#39;t expect that because pin has been the same for 2 years. Am I overreacting and over thinking this pin change? It was the same pin 2 nights ago and now I\u0026#39;m worried that something is happening behind my back. Sure I know I need to talk to him but due to the circumstances I will need to wait a while until he is stable again. It\u0026#39;s just weird ya know? We\u0026#39;ve had issues with his infidelity in the past prior to marriage. I did forgive him. Please be kind. Maybe I\u0026#39;m just a mixture of nerves, lack of sleep and stress. I love him and I\u0026#39;m truly worried about his health. We have kids so there is alot going on in our life .

Evaluate and Compare\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIntegrating older hardware-based security devices into a network can be very challenging. Besides, it increases OPEX and CAPEX. On the other hand, software-based solution efficiently secures your server and network, protects important data, enforces integrity, and confidentiality, scales for accessibility, and alleviates breach risk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003e2. Use Robust Firewall\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to network security, having a strong \u003ca href=\"https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2021/10/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-firewall-in-computer-network.html\"\u003efirewall\u003c/a\u003e serves as a first defense line against any kind of cyber threat. A firewall acts as one important barrier between the internal network and the internet, thus enforcing network security rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt becomes important to upgrade your firewall to meet your security standards, thus ensuring it is configured properly will enhance the network\u0026#8217;s security.

Go for Cyber Threat Assessment\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eCyber threat assessment done by the professional becomes yet another important way to improve network security. This assessment can give you complete knowledge of your network security\u0026#8217;s current state as well as help to identify any kind of vulnerabilities that have to be addressed instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003e4. Train Your Staff\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother effective way to improve network security is educating your staff on healthy security practices.

Encrypt Your Whole Network\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eEncrypting your network is possible. One of the options is IPsec. Windows Server will function as IPsec server, whereas Windows supports its client capabilities natively. However, the encryption procedure will be an important overhead strain on your network, thus resulting in significant drops in an effective throughput rates.

This feature helps improve the customer experience. You can achieve this by catching wrong addresses and becoming more aware of address characteristics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Geocoding API better matches your needs if you do not need to validate individual addresses. The Geocoding API changes addresses into latitude/longitude coordinates. On the other hand, the Address Validation API validates addresses for correctness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a detailed comparison, see the Building location validation using the Google Maps Platform in the Architecture Center.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eChallenges in using address verification\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eImplementing this system may initially require a significant integration effort, particularly if you use large databases or are operating in regions with less standardized addressing systems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe cost of using an advanced address verification service can be a consideration if you have little to no budget.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou should actively monitor the accuracy of the data to make your system effective.

Start by setting up your Google Cloud project and completing the instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, try a simple address and, for additional accuracy, enable CASS (for US and PR addresses only). The address validation API response offers two properties. You can use each of them differently.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, you can help improve address accuracy by providing feedback on Address Validation API responses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe address validation API offers several client libraries, which you can find in the Client libraries. The United States Postal Service (USPS) runs the Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS). This program supports and certifies address validation providers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, CASS doesn’t start working on its own. You need to enable it. To do that, set \u0026#8220;enableUspsCass\u0026#8221; to true as part of a validation request. Note that it is only supported for the \u0026#8220;US\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;PR\u0026#8221; regions.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCheck out “Validate an address” to get more information.
